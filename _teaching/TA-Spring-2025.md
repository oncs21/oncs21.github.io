I served as the teaching assistant for General Biology 2 lab at University of Colorado Boulder. I  was responsible for conducting independent recitations, leading lab activities, and grading student submissions. Here are some quotes from students:

> "Really helpful during labs at explaining the material and always willing to help during office hours."

> "The lab was run pretty well. It was fun and interesting."

> "Onkar was a very smart and fun instructor."

> "Onkar was one of my favorite lab TA, he explained everything very well, and took time to explain every question."
