I served as the teaching assistant for General Biology 2 lab at University of Colorado Boulder. I  was responsible for conducting independent recitations, lead lab activities, and grade assignments. Here are some quotes from students:

> I liked how you made me think critically about the material and guided me to answer the lab questions by myself which helped me learn.

> You seem like you would be a great teacher.

> He’s a great teacher, very patient and considerate!

> Onkar was a very smart and fun instructor.

> Onkar was one of my favorite lab TA, he explained everything very well, and took time to explain every question.
