I served as the teaching assistant for the Geography department at University of Colorado Boulder. I was responsible for conducting lab sessions, answering student questions, and holding office hours every week. Here are some quotes from students:

> "Knowledgeable for sure, thank you for your dedication and would like to wish you best of luck on any future endeavors."

> "You seem like you would be a great teacher."

> "I liked how you made me think critically about the material and guided me to answer the lab questions by myself."

> "Onkar was a great TA."
